\section{Introduction}

The rapid advancement of omics technologies, including (meta)genomics and metabolomics, has been enhanced by breakthroughs in computational methods (\cite{moreno-indias_statistical_2021,marcos-zambrano_toolbox_2023,santamaria_bioinformatic_2024}).
These developments have enabled holo-omics, rapidly emerging field, which uses an integrative approach to comprehensively collect and analyze omic data from both a host organism and its associated microbiome, collectively referred to as the {\it holobiont} (\cite{nyholmHoloOmicsIntegratedHostMicrobiota2020,limborgAppliedHologenomicsFeasibility2018,odriozola_practical_2024}). The holo-omic approach has improved our understanding of complex biological systems, for example, in aquaculture (\cite{limborgAppliedHologenomicsFeasibility2018,atlantic_salmon}).

%This has enabled efficient simultaneous analyses of multiple types of omic data from a single sampleencompassing both host organisms and their diverse microbiomes (\cite{limborgAppliedHologenomicsFeasibility2018}).
%The integration of these diverse information sources has enhanced our understanding of complex diseases, metabolic pathways, and the impact of environmental factors on humans, animals, and plants (\cite{zhangProteogenomicCharacterizationHuman2014}).
%Progress in omics research focuses on discovering how different omics interact to impact phenotype.

%A recent review considered a holo-omic framework for fish (\cite{limborgAppliedHologenomicsFeasibility2018}) to identify potential microorganisms of importance in the production of beneficial fatty acids (e.g. eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids) in fish muscles. This review, together with empirical case studies (\cite{atlantic_salmon}), suggested that aquaculture could be further optimized by combining holo-omic, dietary and environmental data.

Holo-omic research and the collaborative development of computational methods could benefit from curated, open access data resources.
%With the increase of data volume, expenses and time required for data collection rise.
The limited availability of comprehensive multi-omic data resources can impede research progress, constraining computational method development. Open data portals with an accessible Application Programming Interface (API) are crucial in overcoming these challenges. They facilitate research by providing access to data resources and supporting the collaborative development and benchmarking of new data science methods to extract insights from large, curated datasets (\cite{pasolli_2017}).

Data can be limited in value unless it adheres to the FAIR principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reuse) (\cite{wilkinsonFAIRGuidingPrinciples2016}). API interfacing and data wrangling require specialized skills, leading to non-transferable, error-prone workflows, not easily reusable by the wider scientific community. Therefore, standardized open-source workflows are needed to search, retrieve and convert data into a suitable format for downstream analyses.
To narrow the gap between upstream data retrieval and downstream analysis, we developed the HoloFoodR package, which facilitates seamless programmatic linking of the holo-omic data via the HoloFood data portal API and analysis methods from the R/Bioconductor  (\cite{gentleman_bioconductor_2004,callahan_bioconductor_2016}).
%Towards this objective, we are leveraging the the R/Bioconductor methods ecosystem --- an open-source project for developing computational biology tools.

\section{Materials and methods}

The HoloFood data portal is an open access portal of curated holo-omic data and analyses, developed by the international HoloFood consortium (\cite{rogers_holofood_2025}) and hosted by the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI). It centralizes access to heterogeneous data resources including the European Nucleotide Archive for sequence data, MGnify for metagenomic data, and MetaboLights for metabolomic data, and tracks their interrelations via a web portal and free API, covering nearly 10,000 samples from over 2,000 individual chickens and salmon. Biomolecular and physiological measurements were collected at the level of each individual specimen in the project to explore the effects of novel sustainable feeds on physiological processes in farmed animals. In addition, the metadata of each sample is stored in the EMBL-EBI BioSamples service (\cite{courtot_2018}).

We developed a conceptual framework to support best practices of statistical programming in holo-omic research, and implemented the work as the HoloFoodR R software library. The package relies on specialized data containers that have been designed to organize the multi-omic data in a structured format. Once the data has been imported to these formats, users can leverage state-of-the-art statistical programming methods for data processing and analysis.

\vspace{-1em}
\subsection{Integrative data containers}

Data containers provide structured, standardized storage for data, proving useful in life science informatics where complex, hierarchical and multi-source data collections are common to describe the studied phenomenon (\cite{drnevich_2025}). Custom data containers simplify handling diverse omics data, supporting the design of modular and reproducible workflows.

Two data structures are central to our approach, encompassing the needs to organize data for a single omics type, and subsequently link these across multiple omics.
First, the TreeSummarizedExperiment (TreeSE) data container (\cite{huang_treesummarizedexperiment_2021}) standardizes single-omic data, such as metagenome or metabolome derived data sets. It stores experimental data, along with feature and sample metadata, in a structured format. Additionally, it supports the integration of hierarchical information on the features and samples, such as phylogenetic trees. The second container, MultiAssayExperiment (MAE) (\cite{ramos_software_2017}) acts as a logical complement by integrating multiple, heterogeneous omics datasets, seamlessly linking samples across single-omic datasets. Together, these data containers form the basis for an ecosystem of interoperable methods developed by the R/Bioconductor community.

\vspace{-1em}
\subsection{HoloFoodR workflow}

The HoloFoodR package structures data in these single and multi-omic formats, enabling efficient data importing from holo-omic databases for streamlined analysis and integration. The HoloFoodR workflow is summarized in \figref{workflow}. The package uses six functions to query and retrieve data from the HoloFood and MetaboLights databases (Table \ref{tab:holofoodr_functions}). A key feature is its ability to organize versatile data combinations into the MAE data container. Thus, it transforms complex data from the HoloFood API into a standardized structure for downstream statistical analyses in the Bioconductor data science environment  (\cite{ramos_software_2017}).

Furthermore, HoloFoodR leverages the MetaboLights database to retrieve metabolomic datasets indicated by project identifiers in the HoloFood data. The data can then be integrated with complementary metagenomic data resources that are available via the MGnify database using the MGnifyR package (\cite{mgnifyr}).

\subsection{Bioconductor methods ecosystem}

When data from the HoloFood database is retrieved via the HoloFoodR package, users gain direct access to single- and multi-omic downstream analysis methods available in Bioconductor. It currently offers 2,300 packages, developed by a diverse community of individual contributors for a wide range of fields (see e.g. \cite{gentleman_bioconductor_2004,callahan_bioconductor_2016,amezquita_orchestrating_2020,drnevich_2025}). Bioconductor's \texttt{mia} framework centers around these containers and supports a range of analysis and visualization methods for microbiome research (\cite{mia, miaViz, oma}). Similarly, the metabolomic data can be pre-processed, analyzed and visualized with the \texttt{notame} package (\cite{klavus_2020}).

\section{Results}

This section presents a practical use case of applying HoloFoodR in a holo-omics workflow.
The workflow includes the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Fetch and integrate data from the HoloFood and MGnify databases.
    \item Filter, clean, and transform data for analysis.
    \item Explore and summarize the data.
    \item Test associations between fatty acids, time, and treatment.
    \item Test associations between microbiome composition, time, and treatment.
    \item Characterize the joint variation between the parallel omics measurements.
\end{enumerate}

The full workflow, including figures and data refinement, is available in the package vignette at \url{https://ebi-metagenomics.github.io/HoloFoodR/articles/case_study.html}.

\vspace{-1em}
\subsection{Data import and wrangling}

The workflow begins by querying the HoloFood database for available animals. We gathered all salmon entries and their metadata to explore data types and samples. These samples were compiled into an MAE data container. For metagenomic data, we leveraged the capabilities of the MGnifyR package to identify the sample IDs from the MGnify database and fetch the metagenomic data as a MAE object. The consistent data format supports  seamless merging of HoloFood and MGnify datasets. The resulting container holds various types of omics with associated metadata for downstream analyses.

Using the MAE object for data wrangling, we focused on salmon from Trial A in the HoloFood database to study the effects of fermented seaweed as a feed additive. Samples were obtained from animals euthanized at either the start or end of the trial. Fatty acid concentrations were measured in muscle tissue, while metagenomic samples were taken from the intestine.

The \texttt{mia} framework (\cite{mia, miaViz}) provides an intuitive R interface designed for the downstream analysis, especially for microbiome data. We filtered and agglomerated the data to focus on specific microbes and fatty acids, applying centered log-ratio transofrmation to metagenomic data and logarithmic transformation to fatty acid data. The full details are provided in the HoloFoodR package vignette.

\vspace{-1em}
\subsection{Downstream analysis}

After data retrieval and basic exploration, we examined the effects of seaweed treatment and aging. No treatment impact on fatty acid composition was observed, consistent with a recent HoloFood study (\cite{rasmussen_holo-omics_2025}). However, we found temporal effects: as the salmon grew, concentrations of several fatty acids (docosahexaenoic, eicosapentaenoic, linoleic, oleic, palmitic, and stearic) increased (see \figref{workflow}, data analysis panel, which highlights the first two fatty acids).

Microbial community analysis indicated a dominance of {\it Mycoplasma}, consistent with previous studies ({\cite{zarkasiPyrosequencingbasedCharacterizationGastrointestinal2014,bozzi_salmon_2021}}, see \figref{workflow}, data analysis panel). We also observed an increase in microbial diversity (Shannon index) with time, confirmed by Principal Coordinate Analysis (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity).

To explore the co-abundance of fatty acids and microbial genera, we performed multi-omic factor analysis (\cite{argelaguet_mofa_2020}), revealing that {\it Cetobacterium}, {\it Vibrio}, {\it Aliivibrio}, and {\it Photobacterium} covaried with overall fatty acid levels, while {\it Mycoplasma} showed no such correlation.

\section{Discussion and conclusions}
% Context / background / reflection on objectives

Integrating multiple omics layers provides holistic insights into complex systems. Holo-omics is the new field that emphasizes the interactions between the hosts and their microbiomes. However, such analyses rely on curated data, computational environments, and algorithmic tools. Collaborative development and sharing in holo-omics can advance the field and prevent redundant efforts. (\cite{open_microbiome, lahti_open_2018}).

To fill the gap between holo-omic data and downstream analysis methods, we developed the HoloFoodR package. Our work offers programmatic access to the HoloFood data portal and integrates with complementary data sources and Bioconductor analysis tools, supporting open data science in holo-omics.

HoloFoodR simplifies data retrieval by minimizing external data wrangling and adhering to standardized data structures that support efficient use of the multi-omic analyses methods. This standardization replaces lengthy \textit{ad-hoc} code with concise and tested open-source solutions. We demonstrate this approach with an end-to-end workflow, highlighting the use of multi-assay data containers to enhance access to Bioconductor methods.

% Use in teaching
Beyond method development and analysis, HoloFood data can aid in teaching multi-omics techniques. HoloFoodR offers simplified access to real-world omic data, enabling more proficient users to "learn by doingâ. The complexity of this data makes it superior to âtoyâ datasets for teaching advanced data cleaning and analysis skills. (\cite{drnevich_2025}).

The HoloFood data portal currently provides the interconnectivity between the samples and omics datasets, based on BioSamples identifiers. This linkage provides a template for future multiomics datasets, and as the number of datasets increases, the HoloFoodR package could be generalised so that the concepts can be readily applied to other datasets.

% Limitations, implementation issues
Despite the benefits, there are also limitations. First, raw spectral metabolite data from the MetaboLights database requires extensive preprocessing, often with external tools (\cite{klavus_2020}). Whereas the proposed custom data structures can readily support downstream analyses, their construction and use require sufficient R programming skills.

% Concluding sentences
Thus, the methods and open data science strategy that we have suggested can serve as a template for conducting multi-omic analyses. The HoloFoodR package can be adapted for other data resources relevant to holo-omic research, where the growing Bioconductor ecosystem offers an expanding compilation of data analytical tools.

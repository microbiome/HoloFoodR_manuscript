	abstract = {Holo-omics refers to the joint study of non-targeted molecular data layers from host-microbiota systems or holobionts, which is increasingly employed to disentangle the complex interactions between the elements that compose them. We navigate through the generation, analysis, and integration of omics data, focusing on the commonalities and main differences to generate and analyze the various types of omics, with a special focus on optimizing data generation and integration. We advocate for careful generation and distillation of data, followed by independent exploration and analyses of the single omic layers to obtain a better understanding of the study system, before the integration of multiple omic layers in a final model is attempted. We highlight critical decision points to achieve this aim and flag the main challenges to address complex biological questions regarding the integrative study of host-microbiota relationships.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The human microbiome has emerged as a central research topic in human biology and biomedicine. Current microbiome studies generate high-throughput omics data across different body sites, populations, and life stages. Many of the challenges in microbiome research are similar to other high-throughput studies, the quantitative analyses need to address the heterogeneity of data, specific statistical properties, and the remarkable variation in microbiome composition across individuals and body sites. This has led to a broad spectrum of statistical and machine learning challenges that range from study design, data processing, and standardization to analysis, modeling, cross-study comparison, prediction, data science ecosystems, and reproducible reporting. Nevertheless, although many statistics and machine learning approaches and tools have been developed, new techniques are needed to deal with emerging applications and the vast heterogeneity of microbiome data. We review and discuss emerging applications of statistical and machine learning techniques in human microbiome studies and introduce the {COST} Action {CA}18131 “{ML}4Microbiome” that brings together microbiome researchers and machine learning experts to address current challenges such as standardization of analysis pipelines for reproducibility of data analysis results, benchmarking, improvement, or development of existing and new tools and ontologies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The human microbiome has become an area of intense research due to its potential impact on human health. However, the analysis and interpretation of this data have proven to be challenging due to its complexity and high dimensionality. Machine learning ({ML}) algorithms can process vast amounts of data to uncover informative patterns and relationships within the data, even with limited prior knowledge. Therefore, there has been a rapid growth in the development of software specifically designed for the analysis and interpretation of microbiome data using {ML} techniques. These software incorporate a wide range of {ML} algorithms for clustering, classification, regression, or feature selection, to identify microbial patterns and relationships within the data and generate predictive models. This rapid development with a constant need for new developments and integration of new features require efforts into compile, catalog and classify these tools to create infrastructures and services with easy, transparent, and trustable standards. Here we review the state-of-the-art for {ML} tools applied in human microbiome studies, performed as part of the {COST} Action {ML}4Microbiome activities. This scoping review focuses on {ML} based software and framework resources currently available for the analysis of microbiome data in humans. The aim is to support microbiologists and biomedical scientists to go deeper into specialized resources that integrate {ML} techniques and facilitate future benchmarking to create standards for the analysis of microbiome data. The software resources are organized based on the type of analysis they were developed for and the {ML} techniques they implement. A description of each software with examples of usage is provided including comments about pitfalls and lacks in the usage of software based on {ML} methods in relation to microbiome data that need to be considered by developers and users. This review represents an extensive compilation to date, offering valuable insights and guidance for researchers interested in leveraging {ML} approaches for microbiome analysis.},

It follows the convention of the {SummarizedExperiment} class, while providing links between the assays and the nodes of a tree to allow data manipulation at arbitrary levels of the tree. The package is designed to be extensible, allowing new functions on the tree (phylo) to be contributed.

	abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of {PCR}-amplified taxonomic markers (like the 16S {rRNA} gene) has enabled a new level of analysis of complex bacterial communities known as microbiomes. Many tools exist to quantify and compare abundance levels or {OTU} composition of communities in different conditions. The sequencing reads have to be denoised and assigned to the closest taxa from a reference database. Common approaches use a notion of 97\% similarity and normalize the data by subsampling to equalize library sizes. In this paper, we show that statistical models allow more accurate abundance estimates. By providing a complete workflow in R, we enable the user to do sophisticated downstream statistical analyses, whether parametric or nonparametric. We provide examples of using the R packages dada2, phyloseq, {DESeq}2, ggplot2 and vegan to filter, visualize and test microbiome data. We also provide examples of supervised analyses using random forests and nonparametric testing using community networks and the ggnetwork package.},

	abstract = {Metabolites are at the end of the gene–transcript–protein–metabolism cascade. As such, metabolomics is the omics approach that offers the most direct correlation with phenotype. This allows, where genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics fail to explain a trait, metabolomics to possibly provide an answer. Complex phenotypes, which are determined by the influence of multiple small-effect alleles, are an example of these situations. Consequently, the interest in metabolomics has increased exponentially in recent years. As a newer discipline, metabolomic bioinformatic analysis pipelines are not as standardized as in the other omics approaches. In this review, we synthesized the different steps that need to be carried out to obtain biological insight from annotated metabolite abundance raw data. These steps were grouped into three different modules: preprocessing, statistical analysis, and metabolic pathway enrichment. We included within each one of them the different state-of-the-art procedures and tools that can be used depending on the characteristics of the study, providing details about each method’s characteristics and the issues the reader might encounter.

	abstract = {{AIMS}: The relationship of Atlantic salmon gastrointestinal ({GI}) tract bacteria to environmental factors, in particular water temperature within a commercial mariculture system, was investigated. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: Salmon {GI} tract bacterial communities commercially farmed in south-eastern Tasmania were analysed, over a 13-month period across a standard commercial production farm cycle, using 454 16S {rRNA}-based pyrosequencing. Faecal bacterial communities were highly dynamic but largely similar between randomly selected fish. In postsmolt, the faecal bacteria population was dominated by Gram-positive fermentative bacteria; however, by midsummer, members of the family Vibrionaceae predominated. As fish progressed towards harvest, a range of different bacterial genera became more prominent corresponding to a decline in Vibrionaceae. The sampled fish were fed two different commercial diet series with slightly different protein, lipid and digestible energy level; however, the effect of these differences was minimal. {CONCLUSIONS}: The overall data demonstrated dynamic hind gut communities in salmon that were related to season and fish growth phases but were less influenced by differences in commercial diets used routinely within the farm system studied. {SIGNIFICANCE} {AND} {IMPACT} {OF} {THE} {STUDY}: This study provides understanding of farmed salmon {GI} bacterial communities and describes the relative impact of diet, environmental and farm factors.},

	abstract = {The {HoloFood} project used a hologenomic approach to understand the impact of host–microbiota interactions on salmon and chicken production by analysing multiomic data, phenotypic characteristics, and associated metadata in response to novel feeds. The project’s raw data, derived analyses, and metadata are deposited in public, open archives ({BioSamples}, European Nucleotide Archive, {MetaboLights}, and {MGnify}), so making use of these diverse data types may require access to multiple resources. This is especially complex where analysis pipelines produce derived outputs such as functional profiles or genome catalogues. The {HoloFood} Data Portal is a web resource that simplifies access to the project datasets. For example, users can conveniently access multiomic datasets derived from the same individual or retrieve host phenotypic data with a linked gut microbiome sample. Project-specific metagenome-assembled genome and viral catalogues are also provided, linking to broader datasets in {MGnify}. The portal stores only data necessary to provide these relationships, with possible linking to the underlying repositories. The portal showcases a model approach for how future multiomics datasets can be made available.Database {URL}:  https://www.holofooddata.org},

Current technology can reveal many such interactions by combining multi-omic data from both hosts and microbes. However, exploring the full extent of these interactions requires careful consideration of study design for the efficient generation and optimal integration of data derived from (meta)genomics, (meta)transcriptomics, (meta)proteomics, and (meta)metabolomics. In this perspective, we introduce the holo-omic approach that incorporates multi-omic data from both host and microbiota domains to untangle the interplay between the two. We revisit the recent literature on biomolecular host-microbe interactions and discuss the implementation and current limitations of the holo-omic approach. We anticipate that the application of this approach can contribute to opening new research avenues and discoveries in biomedicine, biotechnology, agricultural and aquacultural sciences, nature conservation, as well as basic ecological and evolutionary research., Microbiome; Evolutionary Biology},

Over the past 3 years, {MGnify} has not only grown in terms of the number of datasets contained but also increased the breadth of analyses provided, such as the analysis of long-read sequences. The {MGnify} protein database now exceeds 2.4 billion non-redundant sequences predicted from metagenomic assemblies. This collection is now organised into a relational database making it possible to understand the genomic context of the protein through navigation back to the source assembly and sample metadata, marking a major improvement. To extend beyond the functional annotations already provided in {MGnify}, we have applied deep learning-based annotation methods. The technology underlying {MGnify}'s Application Programming Interface ({API}) and website has been upgraded, and we have enabled the ability to perform downstream analysis of the {MGnify} data through the introduction of a coupled Jupyter Lab environment.},

Since the gut microbiota plays an essential role in regulating the host immune system, health and physiology, altered gut microbiota compositions are often associated with a diseased status. However, few studies have examined the association between disease severity and degree of gut dysbiosis, especially when the gut is not the site of the primary infection. Moreover, there is a lack of knowledge on whether bath treatment with formalin, a disinfectant commonly used in aquaculture to treat external infections, might affect the gut microbiome as a consequence of formalin ingestion. Here we investigate, through 16S {rRNA} gene metabarcoding, changes in the distal gut microbiota composition of a captive-reared cohort of 80 Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.), in consequence of an external bacterial skin infection due to a natural outbreak and subsequent formalin treatment.},

    abstract = { ABSTRACT Animals and their associated microbiota share long evolutionary histories. However, it is not always clear how host genotype and microbiota interact to affect phenotype. We applied a hologenomic approach to explore how host–microbiota interactions shape lifetime growth and parasite infection in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Multi-omics data sets were generated from the guts of 460 salmon, 82\% of which were naturally infected with an intestinal cestode. A single Mycoplasma bacterial strain, MAG01, dominated the gut metagenome of large, non-parasitized fish, consistent with previous studies showing high levels of Mycoplasma in the gut microbiota of healthy salmon. While small and/or parasitized salmon also had high abundance of MAG01, we observed increased alpha diversity in these individuals, driven by increased frequency of low-abundance Vibrionaceae and other Mycoplasma species that carried known virulence genes. Colonization by one of these cestode-associated Mycoplasma strains was associated with host individual genomic variation in long non-coding RNAs. Integrating the multi-omic data sets revealed coordinated changes in the salmon gut mRNA transcriptome and metabolome that correlated with shifts in the microbiota of smaller, parasitized fish. Our results suggest that the gut microbiota of small and/or parasitized fish is in a state of dysbiosis that partly depends on the host genotype, highlighting the value of using a hologenomic approach to incorporate the microbiota into the study of host–parasite dynamics.IMPORTANCE Studying host–microbiota interactions through the perspective of the hologenome is gaining interest across all life sciences. Intestinal parasite infections are a huge burden on human and animal health; however, there are few studies investigating the role of the hologenome during parasite infections. We address this gap in the largest multi-omics fish microbiota study to date using natural cestode infection of farmed Atlantic salmon. We find a clear association between cestode infection, salmon lifetime growth, and perturbation of the salmon gut microbiota. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence that the genetic background of the host may partly determine how the gut microbiota changes during parasite-associated dysbiosis. Our study therefore highlights the value of a hologenomic approach for gaining a more in-depth understanding of parasitism. }

	abstract = {The projected growth of Aquaculture requires continuous optimisation of feeding regimes, especially in enhancing disease resilience through immunostimulating feed supplements. Seaweed has been introduced as a promising supplement due to its proposed immunostimulant effects, while mitigating carbon emissions and marine eutrophication. Two separate growth trials were performed to evaluate the effects of a seaweed supplement, focusing on a closed land-based {RAS} system with fish growing from ∼300–600 g and an open water net-based trial with fish growing from ∼500–2500 g. A multi-omics approach was taken to investigate the effect of using up to 2 \% fermented sugar kelp (Saccharina latissima) as a supplement on the growth performance and gut health of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). Standard growth metrics and quality indicators were coupled with multi-omics data for the host intestinal transcriptome, intestinal metabolome, and intestinal microbiome. Levels of iodine and heavy metals in the fish fillets resulting from seaweed inclusion were evaluated. Seaweed additives up to 2 \% had no negative impact on the salmon growth performance or other health parameters. While concentration of iodine increased with seaweed addition, all levels remain below recommended thresholds. Furthermore, gut transcriptome analyses of 179 individuals revealed multiple indications for an immunostimulant effect of seaweed, including overexpression of the mucin biosynthesis and pyrimidine metabolism pathways related to mucus production and intestinal homeostasis. Genome-resolved metagenomics revealed a core microbiome dominated by Mycoplasma, Photobacterium, and Brevinema species. Interestingly, the assembled genomes of these three core species had consistently higher levels of genome erosion and gene loss compared to other present species suggesting host adaptation. Further, reduced prevalence of known pathogens such as Aliivibrio highlights a potential protective effect of seaweed by impeding growth of opportunistic pathogens. Results suggest that supplementation of up to 2 \% fermented seaweed can increase feed efficiency, stabilise the intestinal microbiome and potentially increase resistance against known pathogenic bacteria including Aliivibrio species.},

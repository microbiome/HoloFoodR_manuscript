We navigate through the generation, analysis, and integration of omics data, focusing on the commonalities and main differences to generate and analyze the various types of omics, with a special focus on optimizing data generation and integration. We advocate for careful generation and distillation of data, followed by independent exploration and analyses of the single omic layers to obtain a better understanding of the study system, before the integration of multiple omic layers in a final model is attempted. We highlight critical decision points to achieve this aim and flag the main challenges to address complex biological questions regarding the integrative study of host-microbiota relationships.},

However, the discovery and comparison of these {MAG} collections is hampered by the lack of uniformity in their generation, annotation and storage. To address this, we have developed {MGnify} Genomes, a growing collection of biome-specific non-redundant microbial genome catalogues generated using {MAGs} and publicly available isolate genomes. Genomes within a biome-specific catalogue are organised into species clusters. For species that contain multiple conspecific genomes, the highest quality genome is selected as the representative, always prioritising an isolate genome over a {MAG}. The species representative sequences and annotations can be visualised on the {MGnify} website and the full catalogue and associated analysis outputs can be downloaded from {MGnify} servers. A suite of online search tools is provided allowing users to compare their own sequences, ranging from a gene to sets of genomes, against the catalogues. Seven biomes are available currently, comprising over 300,000 genomes that represent 11,048 non-redundant species, and include 36 taxonomic classes not currently represented by cultured genomes. {MGnify} Genomes is available at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/browse/genomes/.},

Current microbiome studies generate high-throughput omics data across different body sites, populations, and life stages. Many of the challenges in microbiome research are similar to other high-throughput studies, the quantitative analyses need to address the heterogeneity of data, specific statistical properties, and the remarkable variation in microbiome composition across individuals and body sites. This has led to a broad spectrum of statistical and machine learning challenges that range from study design, data processing, and standardization to analysis, modeling, cross-study comparison, prediction, data science ecosystems, and reproducible reporting. Nevertheless, although many statistics and machine learning approaches and tools have been developed, new techniques are needed to deal with emerging applications and the vast heterogeneity of microbiome data. We review and discuss emerging applications of statistical and machine learning techniques in human microbiome studies and introduce the {COST} Action {CA}18131 “{ML}4Microbiome” that brings together microbiome researchers and machine learning experts to address current challenges such as standardization of analysis pipelines for reproducibility of data analysis results, benchmarking, improvement, or development of existing and new tools and ontologies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The human microbiome has become an area of intense research due to its potential impact on human health. However, the analysis and interpretation of this data have proven to be challenging due to its complexity and high dimensionality. Machine learning ({ML}) algorithms can process vast amounts of data to uncover informative patterns and relationships within the data, even with limited prior knowledge. Therefore, there has been a rapid growth in the development of software specifically designed for the analysis and interpretation of microbiome data using {ML} techniques. These software incorporate a wide range of {ML} algorithms for clustering, classification, regression, or feature selection, to identify microbial patterns and relationships within the data and generate predictive models. This rapid development with a constant need for new developments and integration of new features require efforts into compile, catalog and classify these tools to create infrastructures and services with easy, transparent, and trustable standards. Here we review the state-of-the-art for {ML} tools applied in human microbiome studies, performed as part of the {COST} Action {ML}4Microbiome activities. This scoping review focuses on {ML} based software and framework resources currently available for the analysis of microbiome data in humans. The aim is to support microbiologists and biomedical scientists to go deeper into specialized resources that integrate {ML} techniques and facilitate future benchmarking to create standards for the analysis of microbiome data. The software resources are organized based on the type of analysis they were developed for and the {ML} techniques they implement. A description of each software with examples of usage is provided including comments about pitfalls and lacks in the usage of software based on {ML} methods in relation to microbiome data that need to be considered by developers and users. This review represents an extensive compilation to date, offering valuable insights and guidance for researchers interested in leveraging {ML} approaches for microbiome analysis.},

Several methods exist to perform host phenotype prediction from cross-sectional, single-omics data modalities but decentralized frameworks that jointly analyze multiple time-dependent omics data to highlight the integrative and dynamic impact of repeatedly measured biomarkers are currently limited. In this article, we propose a novel Bayesian ensemble method to consolidate prediction by combining information across several longitudinal and cross-sectional omics data layers. Unlike existing frequentist paradigms, our approach enables uncertainty quantification in prediction as well as interval estimation for a variety of quantities of interest based on posterior summaries. We apply our method to four published multi-omics datasets and demonstrate that it recapitulates known biology in addition to providing novel insights while also outperforming existing methods in estimation, prediction, and uncertainty quantification.

Many tools exist to quantify and compare abundance levels or {OTU} composition of communities in different conditions. The sequencing reads have to be denoised and assigned to the closest taxa from a reference database. Common approaches use a notion of 97\% similarity and normalize the data by subsampling to equalize library sizes. In this paper, we show that statistical models allow more accurate abundance estimates. By providing a complete workflow in R, we enable the user to do sophisticated downstream statistical analyses, whether parametric or nonparametric.

Fish were fed two different diets (Anchovy- and Herring-oil based) that differed in polyunsaturated fatty acid ({PUFA}) concentrations. Anchovy-fed salmon had higher concentrations of {ALA} (alpha-linoleic acid; 18:3n-3), {EPA} (eicosapentaenoic acid; 20:5n-3) and {DPA} (docosapentaenoic acid, 22:5n-3) in their muscle tissues than fish fed the Herring feed. Fish subjected to enhanced {UVB} levels had higher concentrations of {LIN} (linolenic acid, 18:2n-6) and {ALA}, total omega-6 {FA} and {SAFA} (saturated fatty acids) in their tissues compared with fish in reduced {UV} treatments. Concentrations of {ALA}, {LIN}, {GLA} (gamma-linolenic acid; 18:3n-6), {EPA}, {PUFA} and total {FA} were higher in ventral skin of fish exposed to enhanced {UVB} compared with fish in reduced {UV} treatments. Salmon exposed to reduced {UV} weighed more per-unit-length than fish exposed to ambient sunlight. The {FA} profiles suggest that fish exposed to {UV} radiation were more quiescent than fish in the reduced {UV} treatments resulting in a buildup of catabolic substrates.},

	abstract = {Bioinformatic tools for the enrichment of ‘omics’ datasets facilitate interpretation and understanding of data. To date few are suitable for metabolomics datasets. The main objective of this work is to give a critical overview, for the first time, of the performance of these tools. To that aim, datasets from metabolomic repositories were selected and enriched data were created. Both types of data were analysed with these tools and outputs were thoroughly examined. An exploratory multivariate analysis of the most used tools for the enrichment of metabolite sets, based on a non-metric multidimensional scaling ({NMDS}) of Jaccard’s distances, was performed and mirrored their diversity. Codes (identifiers) of the metabolites of the datasets were searched in different metabolite databases ({HMDB}, {KEGG}, {PubChem}, {ChEBI}, {BioCyc}/{HumanCyc}, {LipidMAPS}, {ChemSpider}, {METLIN} and Recon2). The databases that presented more identifiers of the metabolites of the dataset were {PubChem}, followed by {METLIN} and {ChEBI}. However, these databases had duplicated entries and might present false positives. The performance of over-representation analysis ({ORA}) tools, including {BioCyc}/{HumanCyc}, {ConsensusPathDB}, {IMPaLA}, {MBRole}, {MetaboAnalyst}, Metabox, {MetExplore}, {MPEA}, {PathVisio} and Reactome and the mapping tool {KEGGREST}, was examined. Results were mostly consistent among tools and between real and enriched data despite the variability of the tools. Nevertheless, a few controversial results such as differences in the total number of metabolites were also found. Disease-based enrichment analyses were also assessed, but they were not found to be accurate probably due to the fact that metabolite disease sets are not up-to-date and the difficulty of predicting diseases from a list of metabolites. We have extensively reviewed the state-of-the-art of the available range of tools for metabolomic datasets, the completeness of metabolite databases, the performance of {ORA} methods and disease-based analyses. Despite the variability of the tools, they provided consistent results independent of their analytic approach. However, more work on the completeness of metabolite and pathway databases is required, which strongly affects the accuracy of enrichment analyses. Improvements will be translated into more accurate and global insights of the metabolome.},

	abstract = {Metabolites are at the end of the gene–transcript–protein–metabolism cascade. As such, metabolomics is the omics approach that offers the most direct correlation with phenotype. This allows, where genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics fail to explain a trait, metabolomics to possibly provide an answer. Complex phenotypes, which are determined by the influence of multiple small-effect alleles, are an example of these situations. Consequently, the interest in metabolomics has increased exponentially in recent years. As a newer discipline, metabolomic bioinformatic analysis pipelines are not as standardized as in the other omics approaches. In this review, we synthesized the different steps that need to be carried out to obtain biological insight from annotated metabolite abundance raw data. These steps were grouped into three different modules: preprocessing, statistical analysis, and metabolic pathway enrichment. We included within each one of them the different state-of-the-art procedures and tools that can be used depending on the characteristics of the study, providing details about each method’s characteristics and the issues the reader might encounter. Finally, we introduce genome-scale metabolic modeling as a tool for obtaining pseudo-metabolomic data in situations where their acquisition is difficult, enabling the analysis of the resulting data with the modules of the described workflow.},

	abstract = {Executive summary Microbes are all pervasive in their distribution and influence on the functioning and well-being of humans, life in general and the planet. Microbially-based technologies contribute hugely to the supply of important goods and services we depend upon, such as the provision of food, medicines and clean water. They also offer mechanisms and strategies to mitigate and solve a wide range of problems and crises facing humanity at all levels, including those encapsulated in the sustainable development goals ({SDGs}) formulated by the United Nations. For example, microbial technologies can contribute in multiple ways to decarbonisation and hence confronting global warming, provide sanitation and clean water to the billions of people lacking them, improve soil fertility and hence food production and develop vaccines and other medicines to reduce and in some cases eliminate deadly infections. They are the foundation of biotechnology, an increasingly important and growing business sector and source of employment, and the centre of the bioeconomy, Green Deal, etc. But, because microbes are largely invisible, they are not familiar to most people, so opportunities they offer to effectively prevent and solve problems are often missed by decision-makers, with the negative consequences this entrains. To correct this lack of vital knowledge, the International Microbiology Literacy Initiative–the {IMiLI}–is recruiting from the global microbiology community and making freely available, teaching resources for a curriculum in societally relevant microbiology that can be used at all levels of learning. Its goal is the development of a society that is literate in relevant microbiology and, as a consequence, able to take full advantage of the potential of microbes and minimise the consequences of their negative activities. In addition to teaching about microbes, almost every lesson discusses the influence they have on sustainability and the {SDGs} and their ability to solve pressing problems of societal inequalities. The curriculum thus teaches about sustainability, societal needs and global citizenship. The lessons also reveal the impacts microbes and their activities have on our daily lives at the personal, family, community, national and global levels and their relevance for decisions at all levels. And, because effective, evidence-based decisions require not only relevant information but also critical and systems thinking, the resources also teach about these key generic aspects of deliberation. The {IMiLI} teaching resources are learner-centric, not academic microbiology-centric and deal with the microbiology of everyday issues. These span topics as diverse as owning and caring for a companion animal, the vast range of everyday foods that are produced via microbial processes, impressive geological formations created by microbes, childhood illnesses and how they are managed and how to reduce waste and pollution. They also leverage the exceptional excitement of exploration and discovery that typifies much progress in microbiology to capture the interest, inspire and motivate educators and learners alike. The {IMiLI} is establishing Regional Centres to translate the teaching resources into regional languages and adapt them to regional cultures, and to promote their use and assist educators employing them. Two of these are now operational. The Regional Centres constitute the interface between resource creators and educators–learners. As such, they will collect and analyse feedback from the end-users and transmit this to the resource creators so that teaching materials can be improved and refined, and new resources added in response to demand: educators and learners will thereby be directly involved in evolution of the teaching resources. The interactions between educators–learners and resource creators mediated by the Regional Centres will establish dynamic and synergistic relationships–a global societally relevant microbiology education ecosystem–in which creators also become learners, teaching resources are optimised and all players/stakeholders are empowered and their motivation increased. The {IMiLI} concept thus embraces the principle of teaching societally relevant microbiology embedded in the wider context of societal, biosphere and planetary needs, inequalities, the range of crises that confront us and the need for improved decisioning, which should ultimately lead to better citizenship and a humanity that is more sustainable and resilient. Abstract The biosphere of planet Earth is a microbial world: a vast reactor of countless microbially driven chemical transformations and energy transfers that push and pull many planetary geochemical processes, including the cycling of the elements of life, mitigate or amplify climate change (e.g., Nature Reviews Microbiology, 2019, 17, 569) and impact the well-being and activities of all organisms, including humans. Microbes are both our ancestors and creators of the planetary chemistry that allowed us to evolve (e.g., Life's engines: How microbes made earth habitable, 2023). To understand how the biosphere functions, how humans can influence its development and live more sustainably with the other organisms sharing it, we need to understand the microbes. In a recent editorial (Environmental Microbiology, 2019, 21, 1513), we advocated for improved microbiology literacy in society. Our concept of microbiology literacy is not based on knowledge of the academic subject of microbiology, with its multitude of component topics, plus the growing number of additional topics from other disciplines that become vitally important elements of current microbiology. Rather it is focused on microbial activities that impact us–individuals/communities/nations/the human world–and the biosphere and that are key to reaching informed decisions on a multitude of issues that regularly confront us, ranging from personal issues to crises of global importance. In other words, it is knowledge and understanding essential for adulthood and the transition to it, knowledge and understanding that must be acquired early in life in school. The 2019 Editorial marked the launch of the International Microbiology Literacy Initiative, the {IMiLI}. Here, we present our concept of how microbiology literacy may be achieved and the rationale underpinning it; the type of teaching resources being created to realise the concept and the framing of microbial activities treated in these resources in the context of sustainability, societal needs and responsibilities and decision-making; and the key role of Regional Centres that will translate the teaching resources into local languages, adapt them according to local cultural needs, interface with regional educators and develop and serve as hubs of microbiology literacy education networks. The topics featuring in teaching resources are learner-centric and have been selected for their inherent relevance, interest and ability to excite and engage. Importantly, the resources coherently integrate and emphasise the overarching issues of sustainability, stewardship and critical thinking and the pervasive interdependencies of processes. More broadly, the concept emphasises how the multifarious applications of microbial activities can be leveraged to promote human/animal, plant, environmental and planetary health, improve social equity, alleviate humanitarian deficits and causes of conflicts among peoples and increase understanding between peoples (Microbial Biotechnology, 2023, 16(6), 1091–1111). Importantly, although the primary target of the freely available ({CC} {BY}-{NC} 4.0) {IMiLI} teaching resources is schoolchildren and their educators, they and the teaching philosophy are intended for all ages, abilities and cultural spectra of learners worldwide: in university education, lifelong learning, curiosity-driven, web-based knowledge acquisition and public outreach. The {IMiLI} teaching resources aim to promote development of a global microbiology education ecosystem that democratises microbiology knowledge.},

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of dietary supplementation with moderate levels of {ALNA}, γ-linolenic acid ({GLA}), arachidonic acid ({ARA}), {DHA} or {FO} on the proliferation of mitogen-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ({PBMC}) and on the production of cytokines by those cells. The study was randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded and parallel. Healthy subjects ages 55–75 y consumed nine capsules/d for 12 wk; the capsules contained placebo oil (an 80:20 mix of palm and sunflower seed oils) or blends of placebo oil with oils rich in {ALNA}, {GLA}, {ARA} or {DHA} or {FO}. Subjects in these groups consumed 2 g of {ALNA} or 770 mg of {GLA} or 680 mg of {ARA} or 720 mg of {DHA} or 1 g of {EPA} plus {DHA} (720 mg of {EPA} + 280 mg of {DHA}) daily from the capsules. Total fat intake from the capsules was 4 g/d. The fatty acid composition of {PBMC} phospholipids was significantly changed in the {GLA}, {ARA}, {DHA} and {FO} groups. Lymphocyte proliferation was not significantly affected by the placebo, {ALNA}, {ARA} or {DHA} treatments. {GLA} and {FO} caused a significant decrease (up to 65\%) in lymphocyte proliferation. This decrease was partly reversed by 4 wk after stopping the supplementation. None of the treatments affected the production of interleukin-2 or interferon-γ by {PBMC} and none of the treatments affected the number or proportion of T or B lymphocytes, helper or cytotoxic T lymphocytes or memory helper T lymphocytes in the circulation. We conclude that a moderate level {GLA} or {EPA} but not of other (n-6) or (n-3) {PUFA} can decrease lymphocyte proliferation but not production of interleukin-2 or interferon-γ.},

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of dietary supplementation with moderate levels of {ALNA}, gamma-linolenic acid ({GLA}), arachidonic acid ({ARA}), {DHA} or {FO} on the proliferation of mitogen-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ({PBMC}) and on the production of cytokines by those cells. The study was randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded and parallel. Healthy subjects ages 55-75 y consumed nine capsules/d for 12 wk; the capsules contained placebo oil (an 80:20 mix of palm and sunflower seed oils) or blends of placebo oil with oils rich in {ALNA}, {GLA}, {ARA} or {DHA} or {FO}. Subjects in these groups consumed 2 g of {ALNA} or 770 mg of {GLA} or 680 mg of {ARA} or 720 mg of {DHA} or 1 g of {EPA} plus {DHA} (720 mg of {EPA} + 280 mg of {DHA}) daily from the capsules. Total fat intake from the capsules was 4 g/d. The fatty acid composition of {PBMC} phospholipids was significantly changed in the {GLA}, {ARA}, {DHA} and {FO} groups. Lymphocyte proliferation was not significantly affected by the placebo, {ALNA}, {ARA} or {DHA} treatments. {GLA} and {FO} caused a significant decrease (up to 65\%) in lymphocyte proliferation. This decrease was partly reversed by 4 wk after stopping the supplementation. None of the treatments affected the production of interleukin-2 or interferon-gamma by {PBMC} and none of the treatments affected the number or proportion of T or B lymphocytes, helper or cytotoxic T lymphocytes or memory helper T lymphocytes in the circulation. We conclude that a moderate level {GLA} or {EPA} but not of other (n-6) or (n-3) {PUFA} can decrease lymphocyte proliferation but not production of interleukin-2 or interferon-gamma.},

While intestinal microbiota clearly impact the host’s energy balance, their role in intestinal absorption and extraintestinal metabolism of dietary fat is less clear. Using in vivo imaging of fluorescent fatty acid ({FA}) analogs delivered to gnotobiotic zebrafish hosts, we reveal that microbiota stimulate {FA} uptake and lipid droplet ({LD}) formation in the intestinal epithelium and liver. Microbiota increase epithelial {LD} number in a diet-dependent manner. The presence of food led to the intestinal enrichment of bacteria from the phylum Firmicutes. Diet-enriched Firmicutes and their products were sufficient to increase epithelial {LD} number, whereas {LD} size was increased by other bacterial types. Thus, different members of the intestinal microbiota promote {FA} absorption via distinct mechanisms. Diet-induced alterations in microbiota composition might influence fat absorption, providing mechanistic insight into how microbiota-diet interactions regulate host energy balance.},

	abstract = {Extensive genomic characterization of human cancers presents the problem of inference from genomic abnormalities to cancer phenotypes. To address this problem, we analysed proteomes of colon and rectal tumours characterized previously by The Cancer Genome Atlas ({TCGA}) and perform integrated proteogenomic analyses. Somatic variants displayed reduced protein abundance compared to germline variants. Messenger {RNA} transcript abundance did not reliably predict protein abundance differences between tumours. Proteomics identified five proteomic subtypes in the {TCGA} cohort, two of which overlapped with the {TCGA} 'microsatellite instability/{CpG} island methylation phenotype' transcriptomic subtype, but had distinct mutation, methylation and protein expression patterns associated with different clinical outcomes. Although copy number alterations showed strong cis- and trans-effects on {mRNA} abundance, relatively few of these extend to the protein level. Thus, proteomics data enabled prioritization of candidate driver genes. The chromosome 20q amplicon was associated with the largest global changes at both {mRNA} and protein levels; proteomics data highlighted potential 20q candidates, including {HNF}4A (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4, alpha), {TOMM}34 (translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 34) and {SRC} ({SRC} proto-oncogene, non-receptor tyrosine kinase).

Faecal bacterial communities were highly dynamic but largely similar between randomly selected fish. In postsmolt, the faecal bacteria population was dominated by Gram-positive fermentative bacteria; however, by midsummer, members of the family Vibrionaceae predominated. As fish progressed towards harvest, a range of different bacterial genera became more prominent corresponding to a decline in Vibrionaceae. The sampled fish were fed two different commercial diet series with slightly different protein, lipid and digestible energy level; however, the effect of these differences was minimal. {CONCLUSIONS}: The overall data demonstrated dynamic hind gut communities in salmon that were related to season and fish growth phases but were less influenced by differences in commercial diets used routinely within the farm system studied. {SIGNIFICANCE} {AND} {IMPACT} {OF} {THE} {STUDY}: This study provides understanding of farmed salmon {GI} bacterial communities and describes the relative impact of diet, environmental and farm factors.},

This approval is based on the 25\% {CVD} event risk reduction observed with {IPE} in the pre-specified primary composite endpoint (cardiovascular [{CV}] death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or hospitalization for unstable angina) in the landmark Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl-Intervention Trial ({REDUCE}-{IT}). Notably, this reduction in {CVD} event risk with {IPE} was an incremental benefit to well-controlled low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; patients in {REDUCE}-{IT} had elevated triglyceride ({TG}) levels (135-499 mg/{dL}) and either had a history of atherosclerotic {CVD} or diabetes with additional {CV} risk factors. Given the {CVD} event risk reduction in {REDUCE}-{IT}, within a year following trial results, several global medical societies added {IPE} to their clinical guidelines. {IPE} is a stable, highly purified, {FDA}-approved prescription {EPA} ethyl ester. In contrast, mixed omega-3 products (docosahexaenoic acid + {EPA} combinations) have limited or no evidence for {CVD} event risk reduction, and nonprescription fish oil dietary supplements are not regulated as medicine by the {FDA}. We offer our perspective and rationale for why this evidence-based {EPA}-only formulation, {IPE}, should be added to the 'E' in the {ABCDEF} methodology for {CV} prevention. We provide multiple lines of evidence regarding an unmet need for {CVD} prevention beyond statin therapy, {IPE} clinical trials, {IPE} cost-effectiveness analyses, and proposed pleiotropic (non-lipid) mechanisms of action of {EPA}, as well as other relevant clinical considerations.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Next-generation sequencing ({NGS}) has made it possible to determine the sequence and relative abundance of all nucleotides in a biological or environmental sample. A cornerstone of {NGS} is the quantification of {RNA} or {DNA} presence as counts. However, these counts are not counts per se: their magnitude is determined arbitrarily by the sequencing depth, not by the input material. Consequently, counts must undergo normalization prior to use. Conventional normalization methods require a set of assumptions: they assume that the majority of features are unchanged and that all environments under study have the same carrying capacity for nucleotide synthesis. These assumptions are often untestable and may not hold when heterogeneous samples are compared. {RESULTS}: Methods developed within the field of compositional data analysis offer a general solution that is assumption-free and valid for all data. Herein, we synthesize the extant literature to provide a concise guide on how to apply compositional data analysis to {NGS} count data. {CONCLUSIONS}: In highlighting the limitations of total library size, effective library size, and spike-in normalizations, we propose the log-ratio transformation as a general solution to answer the question, "Relative to some important activity of the cell, what is changing?"},

	abstract = {Multi-omic studies of the human gut microbiome are crucial for understanding its role in disease across multiple functional layers. Nevertheless, integrating and analyzing such complex datasets poses significant challenges. Most notably, current analysis methods often yield extensive lists of disease-associated features (e.g., species, pathways, or metabolites), without capturing the multi-layered structure of the data. Here, we address this challenge by introducing “{MintTea}”, an intermediate integration-based approach combining canonical correlation analysis extensions, consensus analysis, and an evaluation protocol. {MintTea} identifies “disease-associated multi-omic modules”, comprising features from multiple omics that shift in concord and that collectively associate with the disease. Applied to diverse cohorts, {MintTea} captures modules with high predictive power, significant cross-omic correlations, and alignment with known microbiome-disease associations. For example, analyzing samples from a metabolic syndrome study, {MintTea} identifies a module with serum glutamate- and {TCA} cycle-related metabolites, along with bacterial species linked to insulin resistance. In another dataset, {MintTea} identifies a module associated with late-stage colorectal cancer, including Peptostreptococcus and Gemella species and fecal amino acids, in line with these species’ metabolic activity and their coordinated gradual increase with cancer development. This work demonstrates the potential of advanced integration methods in generating systems-level, multifaceted hypotheses underlying microbiome-disease interactions.},

	abstract = {Recent animal work suggests that gamma-linolenic acid ({GLA}) and eicosapentaenoic acid ({EPA}) enhance calcium absorption, reduce excretion and increase calcium deposition in bone. A pilot study was set up to test the interactions between calcium and {GLA}+{EPA} in humans. Sixty-five women (mean age 79.5), taking a background diet low in calcium, were randomly assigned to {GLA}+{EPA} or coconut oil placebo capsules; in addition, all received 600 mg/day calcium as the carbonate. Markers of bone formation/degradation and bone mineral density ({BMD}) were measured at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 months. Twenty-one patients were continued on treatment for a second period of 18 months, after which {BMD} (36 months) was measured. At 18 months, osteocalcin and deoxypyridinoline levels fell significantly in both groups, indicating a decrease in bone turnover, whereas bone specific alkaline phosphatase rose indicating beneficial effects of calcium given to all the patients. Lumbar and femoral {BMD}, in contrast, showed different effects in the two groups. Over the first 18 months, lumbar spine density remained the same in the treatment group, but decreased 3.2\% in the placebo group. Femoral bone density increased 1.3\% in the treatment group, but decreased 2.1\% in the placebo group. During the second period of 18 months with all patients now on active treatment, lumbar spine density increased 3.1\% in patients who remained on active treatment, and 2.3\% in patients who switched from placebo to active treatment; femoral {BMD} in the latter group showed an increase of 4.7\%. This pilot controlled study suggests that {GLA} and {EPA} have beneficial effects on bone in this group of elderly patients, and that they are safe to administer for prolonged periods of time.},

	abstract = {Globally, penaeid shrimp are the most farmed and traded aquatic organisms, although they are easily susceptible to microbial pathogens. Moreover, there is a desire to increase the nutritional value of shrimp, especially the levels of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ({PUFAs}), such as eicosapentaenoic acid ({EPA}) and docosahexaenoic acid ({DHA}), which also possess immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties. Some aquatic animals can synthesize {EPA} and {DHA} from dietary plant-sourced alpha-linolenic acid ({ALA}), but penaeid shrimps' ability to synthesize these n-3 {PUFAs} is unknown. Here, molecular biology techniques, including gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, {qPCR}, {ELISA}, etc., were used to demonstrate that exogenous {ALA} or Vibrio parahaemolyticus could modulate {EPA} and {DHA} levels and immune genes in Penaeus vannamei by inducing key enzymes involved in n-3 {PUFAs} biosynthesis, such as delta desaturases and elongation of very long-chain fatty acid ({ELOVLs}). Most importantly, knockdown or inhibition of ∆6 desaturase significantly decreased {EPA} and {DHA} levels and immune gene expression even with exogenous {ALA} treatment, consequently affecting shrimp antibacterial immunity and survival. This study provides new insight into the potential of P. vannamei to synthesize n-3 {PUFAs} from exogenous {ALA} or upon bacteria challenge, which could be leveraged to increase their nutritional content and antimicrobial immunity.},

Breast adipose tissue specimens were collected during breast surgery. We established the biochemical profile of adipose tissue fatty acids ({FA}) by gas chromatography and assessed whether there were differences in function of the presence of breast inflammation or not. {RESULTS}: We found that {IBC} was associated with decreased levels in breast adipose tissue of eicosapentaenoic acid ({EPA}), one of the two main polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids (n-3 {PUFA}) of marine origin, but also with decreased levels of Gamma Linolenic acid ({GLA}). Inversely, an increase in palmitic acid levels was associated with {IBC}. {CONCLUSION}: These differences in lipid content may contribute to the occurrence of breast cancer inflammation.},

However, few studies have examined the association between disease severity and degree of gut dysbiosis, especially when the gut is not the site of the primary infection. Moreover, there is a lack of knowledge on whether bath treatment with formalin, a disinfectant commonly used in aquaculture to treat external infections, might affect the gut microbiome as a consequence of formalin ingestion.

	abstract = {The present study aimed to determine if the long-chain {MUFA} cetoleic acid (22 : 1n-11) can improve the capacity to synthesise the health-promoting n-3 fatty acids {EPA} and {DHA} in human and fish models. Human hepatocytes ({HepG}2) and salmon primary hepatocytes were first enriched with cetoleic acid, and thereafter their capacities to convert radio-labelled 18 : 3n-3 (α-linolenic acid, {ALA}) to {EPA} and {DHA} were measured. Increased endogenous levels of cetoleic acid led to increased production of radio-labelled {EPA} + {DHA} in {HepG}2 by 40 \% and {EPA} in salmon hepatocytes by 12 \%. In order to verify if dietary intake of a fish oil rich in cetoleic acid would have the same beneficial effects on the n-3 fatty acid metabolic pathway in vivo as found in vitro, Atlantic salmon were fed four diets supplemented with either sardine oil low in cetoleic acid or herring oil high in cetoleic acid at two inclusion levels (Low or High). The diets were balanced for {EPA} + {DHA} content within the Low and within the High groups. The salmon were fed these diets from 110 to 242 g. The level of {EPA} + {DHA} in liver and whole-body retention of docosapentaenoic acid and {EPA} + {DHA} relative to what was eaten, increased with increased dietary cetoleic acid levels. Thus, it is concluded that cetoleic acid stimulated the synthesis of {EPA} and {DHA} from {ALA} in human {HepG}2 and of {EPA} in salmon hepatocytes in vitro and increased whole-body retention of {EPA} + {DHA} in salmon by 15 \% points after dietary intake of cetoleic acid.},

    abstract = { ABSTRACT Animals and their associated microbiota share long evolutionary histories. However, it is not always clear how host genotype and microbiota interact to affect phenotype. We applied a hologenomic approach to explore how host–microbiota interactions shape lifetime growth and parasite infection in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Multi-omics data sets were generated from the guts of 460 salmon, 82\% of which were naturally infected with an intestinal cestode. A single Mycoplasma bacterial strain, MAG01, dominated the gut metagenome of large, non-parasitized fish, consistent with previous studies showing high levels of Mycoplasma in the gut microbiota of healthy salmon. While small and/or parasitized salmon also had high abundance of MAG01, we observed increased alpha diversity in these individuals, driven by increased frequency of low-abundance Vibrionaceae and other Mycoplasma species that carried known virulence genes. Colonization by one of these cestode-associated Mycoplasma strains was associated with host individual genomic variation in long non-coding RNAs. Integrating the multi-omic data sets revealed coordinated changes in the salmon gut mRNA transcriptome and metabolome that correlated with shifts in the microbiota of smaller, parasitized fish. Our results suggest that the gut microbiota of small and/or parasitized fish is in a state of dysbiosis that partly depends on the host genotype, highlighting the value of using a hologenomic approach to incorporate the microbiota into the study of host–parasite dynamics.IMPORTANCE Studying host–microbiota interactions through the perspective of the hologenome is gaining interest across all life sciences. Intestinal parasite infections are a huge burden on human and animal health; however, there are few studies investigating the role of the hologenome during parasite infections. We address this gap in the largest multi-omics fish microbiota study to date using natural cestode infection of farmed Atlantic salmon. We find a clear association between cestode infection, salmon lifetime growth, and perturbation of the salmon gut microbiota. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence that the genetic background of the host may partly determine how the gut microbiota changes during parasite-associated dysbiosis. Our study therefore highlights the value of a hologenomic approach for gaining a more in-depth understanding of parasitism. }

Two separate growth trials were performed to evaluate the effects of a seaweed supplement, focusing on a closed land-based {RAS} system with fish growing from ∼300–600 g and an open water net-based trial with fish growing from ∼500–2500 g. A multi-omics approach was taken to investigate the effect of using up to 2 \% fermented sugar kelp (Saccharina latissima) as a supplement on the growth performance and gut health of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). Standard growth metrics and quality indicators were coupled with multi-omics data for the host intestinal transcriptome, intestinal metabolome, and intestinal microbiome. Levels of iodine and heavy metals in the fish fillets resulting from seaweed inclusion were evaluated. Seaweed additives up to 2 \% had no negative impact on the salmon growth performance or other health parameters. While concentration of iodine increased with seaweed addition, all levels remain below recommended thresholds. Furthermore, gut transcriptome analyses of 179 individuals revealed multiple indications for an immunostimulant effect of seaweed, including overexpression of the mucin biosynthesis and pyrimidine metabolism pathways related to mucus production and intestinal homeostasis. Genome-resolved metagenomics revealed a core microbiome dominated by Mycoplasma, Photobacterium, and Brevinema species. Interestingly, the assembled genomes of these three core species had consistently higher levels of genome erosion and gene loss compared to other present species suggesting host adaptation. Further, reduced prevalence of known pathogens such as Aliivibrio highlights a potential protective effect of seaweed by impeding growth of opportunistic pathogens. Results suggest that supplementation of up to 2 \% fermented seaweed can increase feed efficiency, stabilise the intestinal microbiome and potentially increase resistance against known pathogenic bacteria including Aliivibrio species.},
